	/*
 	1)Garbage Collector deatroys the "finalized" objects
 	2)To finalize an object Java uses "finalize()" method
 	3)If you want you can call "finalize()" method among your code but
 	  Java decides when and how to use finalize() method.
*/

/*
 	Explain "final", "finally", and "finalize"?
 	
 	1)"final" is a keyword, "finally" is a code block, "finalize" is a method
 	2)"final" ==> a)final variables:
 						i)Final variables must be initialized
 						ii)Final variable values cannot be modified
 						ii)Final variables should be named by using uppercases
 	              b)final methods:
 	              		i)Final methods cannot be overridden but can be overloaded
 	              c)final classes:
 	              		i)Final classes cannot have child classes. No inheritance, no extends.
 	              		
   3)"finally" ==> a)It is used with try block or try-catch block  
                   b)It is executed when the exception is thrown or the exception is not thrown
                   c)It is used to end connections with database, or cloud or it is used to 
                     close a file.
   
   4)"finalize" ==> a)It is executed before Garbage Collector destroys the objects
