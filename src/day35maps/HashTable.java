	 	What is the difference between "HashMap" and "HashTable"?
	 	
	 	1)HashMap accepts "null" in "key" just once and in "value" many times
	 	  HashTable does NOT accept null in anywhere
	 	  
	 	2)HashMap is not thread-safe and not synchronized.(Fast)
	 	  HashTable is thread-safe and synchronized.(Slow)
	 	  
	 	Note: Both put the elements in random order
