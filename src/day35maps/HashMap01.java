	 	How a HashMap works internally in Java
	 	1)If you fill 75% of buckets Java creates new
	 	  16 buckets. This is called "Load Factor"
	 	2)Java creates "HashCode" by using "Key", then converts the hashcode to existing indexes then put the data
	 	  into bucket by using the index.
	 	3)Sometimes the indexes which are created form HashCodes can be same, this is called "Hash Collision".
	 	4)Java uses LinkedList in every bucket. If "Hash Collision" occurs, Java can put multiple data into a bucket
	 	  by using linked list structure.
